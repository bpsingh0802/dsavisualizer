# DSA Visualizer

## Overview

DSA Visualizer is an interactive web application that helps users understand and visualize various data structures and algorithms. This tool provides step-by-step animations for different algorithms, making it easier to grasp their working principles.





## Features

### Visualization of Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
This feature provides interactive visualizations of various sorting algorithms, helping users understand how elements are arranged step by step. Each algorithm is displayed with animations to illustrate key operations like comparisons, swaps, and partitions.

### Cosmic Mode
Cosmic Mode enhances the visualization experience by adding dynamic background effects, making algorithm animations visually appealing and engaging. It provides an immersive learning experience while keeping track of each algorithm's execution.

### Race Mode
Race Mode allows users to compare multiple sorting algorithms simultaneously. By running different algorithms side by side on the same dataset, users can observe performance differences in real time and better understand the efficiency of each approach.

### Custom Input, Array, and Visualization Speed
Users can provide custom input arrays, adjust the size of the dataset, and control the speed of the visualization. This enables experimentation with different cases, such as sorted, reversed, or random inputs, to analyze how each algorithm performs under various conditions.

### Customizable Input Data
Beyond sorting, users can modify input data for other visualized algorithms like graph traversals or tree operations. This flexibility allows users to explore different scenarios and observe how algorithms adapt to different data structures.
